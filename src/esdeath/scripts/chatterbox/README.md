---

### 📦 Portable Mode (Windows)

On Windows, the launcher offers **Portable Mode** — a fully self-contained installation where the entire project folder, including its own private Python runtime and all dependencies, lives in one place. Unlike standard Python virtual environments (which use hardcoded absolute paths and break when moved), the portable installation uses only relative paths and works from any location.

#### What You Can Do With It

Once the first-time setup completes, the entire project folder can be:

*   **Copied to a different directory** on the same machine — it still works.
*   **Copied to a USB drive** and run on another Windows PC — no Python needed on that machine.
*   **Zipped up and shared** with someone else — they unzip, double-click `start.bat`, and it runs.
*   **Moved anywhere** on the filesystem without breaking anything.

The recipient doesn't need Python installed, doesn't need to run any setup, and doesn't need an internet connection to launch the server (see note about models below).

#### First Run vs. Subsequent Runs

*   **First run:** The launcher sets up the portable Python environment and installs all dependencies (PyTorch, CUDA libraries, etc.). This requires an internet connection and takes a few minutes. The resulting folder will be several GB due to PyTorch and GPU libraries.
*   **Subsequent runs:** The launcher detects the existing portable environment and starts the server in seconds. No internet needed, no setup repeated.

#### Note About Model Downloads

The TTS models (~2+ GB) are downloaded from Hugging Face Hub into a **separate cache folder** the first time the server starts on any machine. This is a one-time download per machine, independent of the portable application folder.

If you're sharing a portable installation, the recipient will need an internet connection for this initial model download on their first run. To pre-include models in the portable package, you can set the `model_cache` path in `config.yaml` to a folder inside the project directory, then include it when sharing.

#### When Does the Portable Prompt Appear?

During first-time setup on Windows, the launcher offers a choice:

*   **Portable Mode** (recommended, default): Creates a self-contained `python_embedded/` environment inside the project folder. Works with any system Python 3.10+.
*   **Standard installation**: Uses a regular Python virtual environment (`venv/`). Works fine but is not portable.

On **Python 3.11+**, Portable Mode is especially recommended because it also resolves compatibility issues with missing binary packages (ONNX, ONNXRuntime) that affect newer Python versions on Windows.

You can skip the prompt entirely with command-line flags:
*   `python start.py --portable` — go straight to portable mode
*   `python start.py --no-portable` — go straight to standard venv
*   `python start.py --reinstall --portable` — switch an existing installation to portable mode

#### Not Available on Linux / macOS

Portable Mode is Windows-specific. On Linux and macOS, the standard virtual environment is used. This works reliably on those platforms because the dependency compatibility issues that motivated portable mode are Windows-specific.

#### GPU Drivers Still Required

Portable Mode includes Python and all Python packages, but **GPU drivers are not included**. If the target machine has an NVIDIA GPU and you want GPU acceleration, the appropriate NVIDIA drivers must be installed on that machine. CPU mode works without any drivers.

<details>
<summary><strong>🔧 Technical Details (for developers/contributors)</strong></summary>

**How it works under the hood:**

*   Portable Mode uses the official **CPython 3.10.11 embeddable distribution** from python.org — a minimal, self-contained Python runtime (~8 MB before dependencies are installed).
*   The embeddable distribution's `python310._pth` file is patched to use **relative paths** (`.`, `..`, `Lib\site-packages`). The `..` entry resolves to the project root since `python_embedded/` is always one level deep. This is what makes portability work — no absolute paths are written anywhere.
*   There is no virtual environment activation step. No `activate.bat`, no `activate.ps1`, no hardcoded paths. The launcher simply runs `python_embedded/python.exe` directly.
*   The launcher bootstraps `pip` via `get-pip.py`, explicitly installs `setuptools` (needed by the `perth` watermarking library at runtime), generates a `sitecustomize.py` for DLL search path configuration, and patches the TTS engine's watermarker initialization for resilience.
*   The `start.bat` batch file finds any system Python to launch `start.py`, which then detects the existing `python_embedded/` directory and uses it — regardless of which system Python version invoked the launcher.

### 📋 Manual Installation

For users who prefer manual control over the installation process.

**2. Create a Python Virtual Environment**

Using a virtual environment is crucial to avoid conflicts with other projects.

*   **Windows (PowerShell):**
    ```powershell
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

*   **Linux (Bash):**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
    Your command prompt should now start with `(venv)`.

**3. Choose Your Installation Path**

Pick one of the following commands based on your hardware. This single command will install all necessary dependencies with compatible versions.

---

### **Option 1: CPU-Only Installation**

This is the most straightforward option and works on any machine without a compatible GPU.

```bash
# Make sure your (venv) is active
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

<details>
<summary><strong>💡 How This Works</strong></summary>
The `requirements.txt` file is specially crafted for CPU users. It tells `pip` to use PyTorch's CPU-specific package repository and pins compatible versions of `torch` and `torchvision`. This prevents `pip` from installing mismatched versions, which is a common source of errors.
</details>

---

### **Option 2: NVIDIA GPU Installation (CUDA 12.1)**

For users with NVIDIA GPUs. This provides the best performance for RTX 20/30/40 series.

**Prerequisite:** Ensure you have the latest NVIDIA drivers installed.

```bash
# Make sure your (venv) is active
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements-nvidia.txt
```

**After installation, verify that PyTorch can see your GPU:**
```bash
python -c "import torch; print(f'PyTorch version: {torch.__version__}'); print(f'CUDA available: {torch.cuda.is_available()}'); print(f'Device name: {torch.cuda.get_device_name(0) if torch.cuda.is_available() else None}')"
```
If `CUDA available:` shows `True`, your setup is correct!

<details>
<summary><strong>💡 How This Works</strong></summary>
The `requirements-nvidia.txt` file instructs `pip` to use PyTorch's official CUDA 12.1 package repository. It pins specific, compatible versions of `torch`, `torchvision`, and `torchaudio` that are built with CUDA support. This guarantees that the versions required by `chatterbox-tts` are met with the correct GPU-enabled libraries, preventing conflicts.
</details>

---

### **Option 2b: NVIDIA GPU with CUDA 12.8 (RTX 5090 / Blackwell)**

> **Note:** Only use this if you have an **RTX 5090** or other **Blackwell-based GPU**. For RTX 3000/4000 series, use Option 2 above.

For users with the latest NVIDIA RTX 5090 or other Blackwell architecture GPUs that require CUDA 12.8 and sm_120 support.

**Prerequisites:**
- NVIDIA RTX 5090 or Blackwell-based GPU
- CUDA 12.8+ drivers (driver version 570+)

**Using Docker (Recommended for RTX 5090):**
```bash
# Build and start with CUDA 12.8 support
docker compose -f docker-compose-cu128.yml up -d

# Access the web UI at http://localhost:8004
```

**Manual Installation:**
```bash
# Make sure your (venv) is active
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements-nvidia-cu128.txt
pip install --no-deps git+https://github.com/devnen/chatterbox-v2.git@master
```

⚠️ **Critical:** The `--no-deps` flag is required to prevent PyTorch from being downgraded to a version that doesn't support Blackwell GPUs.

**After installation, verify that PyTorch supports sm_120:**
```bash
python -c "import torch; print(f'PyTorch: {torch.__version__}'); print(f'CUDA: {torch.cuda.is_available()}'); print(f'GPU: {torch.cuda.get_device_name(0)}'); print(f'Architectures: {torch.cuda.get_arch_list()}')"
```

You should see `sm_120` in the architectures list!

<details>
<summary><strong>💡 Why CUDA 12.8?</strong></summary>

The RTX 5090 uses NVIDIA's new **Blackwell architecture** with compute capability **sm_120**. PyTorch 2.8.0 with CUDA 12.8 is the first stable release that includes support for this architecture. Earlier versions (including CUDA 12.1) will fail with the error: `CUDA error: no kernel image is available for execution on the device`.

See [README_CUDA128.md](README_CUDA128.md) for detailed setup instructions and troubleshooting.
</details>

---

### **Option 3: AMD GPU Installation (ROCm)**

For users with modern, ROCm-compatible AMD GPUs.

**Prerequisite:** Ensure you have the latest ROCm drivers installed on a Linux system.

```bash
# Make sure your (venv) is active
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements-rocm.txt
```

**After installation, verify that PyTorch can see your GPU:**
```bash
python -c "import torch; print(f'PyTorch version: {torch.__version__}'); print(f'ROCm available: {torch.cuda.is_available()}'); print(f'Device name: {torch.cuda.get_device_name(0) if torch.cuda.is_available() else None}')"
```
If `ROCm available:` shows `True`, your setup is correct!

<details>
<summary><strong>💡 How This Works</strong></summary>
The `requirements-rocm.txt` file works just like the NVIDIA one, but it points `pip` to PyTorch's official ROCm 6.4.1 package repository. This ensures that the correct GPU-enabled libraries for AMD hardware are installed, providing a stable and performant environment.
</details>

---

### **Option 4: Apple Silicon (MPS) Installation**

For users with Apple Silicon Macs (M1, M2, M3, M4, etc.).

**Prerequisite:** Ensure you have macOS 12.3 or later for MPS support.

**Step 1: Install PyTorch with MPS support first**
```bash
# Make sure your (venv) is active
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
```

**Step 2: Configure the server to use MPS**
Update your `config.yaml` to use MPS instead of CUDA:
```yaml
tts_engine:
  device: mps  # Changed from 'cuda' to 'mps'
```

**Step 3: Install remaining dependencies**
```bash
# Install chatterbox-tts without its dependencies to avoid conflicts
pip install --no-deps git+https://github.com/devnen/chatterbox-v2.git@master

# Install core server dependencies
pip install fastapi 'uvicorn[standard]' librosa safetensors soundfile pydub audiotsm praat-parselmouth python-multipart requests aiofiles PyYAML watchdog unidecode inflect tqdm

# Install missing chatterbox dependencies
pip install conformer==0.3.2 diffusers==0.29.0 resemble-perth==1.0.1 transformers==4.46.3

# Install s3tokenizer without its problematic dependencies
pip install --no-deps s3tokenizer

# Install a compatible version of ONNX and audio codec
pip install onnx==1.16.0 descript-audio-codec
```

**After installation, verify that PyTorch can see your GPU:**
```bash
python -c "import torch; print(f'PyTorch version: {torch.__version__}'); print(f'MPS available: {torch.backends.mps.is_available()}'); print(f'Device will use: {\"mps\" if torch.backends.mps.is_available() else \"cpu\"}')"
```
If `MPS available:` shows `True`, your setup is correct!

<details>
<summary><strong>💡 Why This Process Is Different</strong></summary>
Apple Silicon requires a specific installation sequence due to dependency conflicts between the pinned PyTorch versions in chatterbox-tts and the latest PyTorch versions that support MPS. By installing PyTorch first with MPS support, then carefully installing dependencies while avoiding version conflicts, we ensure MPS acceleration works properly. The server's automatic device detection will use MPS when configured and available.
</details>
```

---

*Prefer local installation? Continue reading below for full setup instructions.*

## ⚙️ Configuration

The server relies exclusively on `config.yaml` for runtime configuration.

*   **`config.yaml`:** Located in the project root. This file stores all server settings, model paths, generation defaults, and UI state. It is created automatically on the first run (using defaults from `config.py`) if it doesn't exist. **This is the main file to edit for persistent configuration changes.**
*   **UI Configuration:** The "Server Configuration" and "Generation Parameters" sections in the Web UI allow direct editing and saving of values *into* `config.yaml`.

**Key Configuration Areas (in `config.yaml` or UI):**

*   `server`: `host`, `port`, logging settings.
*   `model`: `repo_id` (e.g., "ResembleAI/chatterbox").
*   `tts_engine`: `device` ('auto', 'cuda', 'mps', 'cpu'), `predefined_voices_path`, `reference_audio_path`, `default_voice_id`.
*   `paths`: `model_cache` (for `download_model.py`), `output`.
*   `generation_defaults`: Default UI values for `temperature`, `exaggeration`, `cfg_weight`, `seed`, `speed_factor`, `language`.
*   `audio_output`: `format`, `sample_rate`, `max_reference_duration_sec`.
*   `ui_state`: Stores the last used text, voice mode, file selections, etc., for UI persistence.
*   `ui`: `title`, `show_language_select`, `max_predefined_voices_in_dropdown`.
*   `debug`: `save_intermediate_audio`.

⭐ **Remember:** Changes made to `server`, `model`, `tts_engine`, or `paths` sections in `config.yaml` (or via the UI's Server Configuration section) **require a server restart** to take effect. Changes to `generation_defaults` or `ui_state` are applied dynamically or on the next page load.

## ▶️ Running the Server

**Important Note on Model Downloads (First Run):**
The very first time you start the server, it needs to download the `chatterbox-tts` model files from Hugging Face Hub. This is an **automatic, one-time process** (per model version, or until your Hugging Face cache is cleared).

*   ⏳ **Please be patient:** This download can take several minutes, depending on your internet speed and the size of the model files (typically a few gigabytes).
*   📝 **Monitor your terminal:** You'll see progress indicators or logs related to the download. The server will only become fully operational and accessible *after* these essential model files are successfully downloaded and loaded.
*   ✔️ **Subsequent starts will be much faster** as the server will use the already downloaded models from your local Hugging Face cache.

You can *optionally* use the `python download_model.py` script to pre-download specific model components to the `./model_cache` directory defined in `config.yaml`. However, please note that the runtime engine (`engine.py`) primarily loads the model from the main Hugging Face Hub cache directly, not this specific local `model_cache` directory.

### Using the Automated Launcher (Recommended)

The easiest way to run the server is using the automated launcher:

**Windows:**
```bash
start.bat
```

**Linux / macOS:**
```bash
./start.sh
```

The launcher automatically:
- Activates the virtual environment
- Verifies the installation is complete
- Starts the server
- Waits for the server to be ready (including model download on first run)
- Displays the access URLs when ready

### Manual Server Start

If you prefer to start the server manually:

**Steps to Run:**

1.  **Activate the virtual environment (if not activated):**
    *   Linux/macOS: `source venv/bin/activate`
    *   Windows: `.\venv\Scripts\activate`
2.  **Run the server:**
    ```bash
    python server.py
    ```
3.  **Access the UI:** After the server starts (and completes any initial model downloads), it should automatically attempt to open the Web UI in your default browser. If it doesn't, manually navigate to `http://localhost:PORT` (e.g., `http://localhost:8004` if your configured port is 8004).
4.  **Access API Docs:** Open `http://localhost:PORT/docs` for interactive API documentation.
5.  **Stop the server:** Press `CTRL+C` in the terminal where the server is running.
```

## 🔄 Updating to the Latest Version

Follow these steps to update your local installation to the latest version from GitHub. This guide provides multiple methods: using the automated launcher, the recommended `git stash` workflow, and a manual backup alternative. All methods preserve your local `config.yaml`.

**First, Navigate to Your Project Directory**

Before starting, open your terminal and go to the project folder.

```bash
cd Chatterbox-TTS-Server
```

---

### **Method 1: Using the Automated Launcher (Easiest)**

The launcher provides simple upgrade functionality that handles everything automatically.

**Upgrade (keeps your hardware selection):**
```bash
# First, pull the latest code
git pull origin main

# Then upgrade dependencies using the launcher
# Windows
python start.py --upgrade

# Linux/macOS
python3 start.py --upgrade
```

**Full Reinstall (choose new hardware option):**
```bash
git pull origin main

# Windows
python start.py --reinstall

# Linux/macOS
python3 start.py --reinstall
```

The `--upgrade` flag preserves your current hardware selection (CPU, NVIDIA, etc.) and reinstalls dependencies.

The `--reinstall` flag removes the existing installation completely and shows the hardware selection menu again.

**Changing Hardware Configuration:**

To switch to a different hardware configuration (e.g., from CPU to NVIDIA, or from CUDA 12.1 to CUDA 12.8):

```bash
# Shows menu to select new hardware
python start.py --reinstall

# Or specify directly
python start.py --reinstall --nvidia
python start.py --reinstall --nvidia-cu128
python start.py --reinstall --cpu
python start.py --reinstall --rocm
```

---

### **Method 2: Stash and Pop (Recommended for Manual Installation)**

If you installed manually without using the launcher, this is the standard and safest way to update using Git. It automatically handles your local changes (like to `config.yaml`) without needing to manually copy files.

**First, activate your virtual environment:**

```bash
# On Windows (PowerShell):
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# On Linux (Bash):
source venv/bin/activate
```

*   **Step 1: Stash Your Local Changes**
    This command safely stores your modifications on a temporary "shelf."
    ```bash
    git stash
    ```

*   **Step 2: Pull the Latest Version**
    Now that your local changes are safely stored, you can download the latest code from GitHub.
    ```bash
    git pull origin main
    ```

*   **Step 3: Re-apply Your Changes**
    This command takes your changes from the shelf and applies them back to the updated code.
    ```bash
    git stash pop
    ```
    Your `config.yaml` will now have your settings, and the rest of the project files will be up-to-date. You can now proceed to the **"Final Steps"** section below.

---

### **Method 3: Manual Backup (Alternative)**

This method involves manually backing up and restoring your configuration file.

**First, activate your virtual environment:**

```bash
# On Windows (PowerShell):
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# On Linux (Bash):
source venv/bin/activate
```

*   **Step 1: Backup Your Configuration**
    ⚠️ **Important:** Create a backup of your `config.yaml` to preserve your custom settings.
    ```bash
    # Create a backup of your current configuration
    cp config.yaml config.yaml.backup
    ```

*   **Step 2: Update the Repository**
    Choose one of the following commands based on your needs:
    *   **Standard Update (recommended):**
        ```bash
        git pull origin main
        ```
        If you encounter merge conflicts with `config.yaml`, you may need to resolve them manually.
    *   **Force Update (if you have conflicts or want to ensure a clean update):**
        ```bash
        # Fetch latest changes and reset to match remote exactly
        git fetch origin
        git reset --hard origin/main
        ```

*   **Step 3: Restore Your Configuration**
    ```bash
    # Restore your backed-up configuration
    cp config.yaml.backup config.yaml
    ```
    Now, proceed to the **"Final Steps"** section.

---

### **Final Steps (For Methods 2 & 3)**

After you have updated the code using Method 2 or 3, complete these final steps.

**1. Check for New Configuration Options**

⭐ **Recommended:** Compare your restored `config.yaml` with the new default config to see if there are new options you might want to adopt. The server will add new keys with default values, but you may want to review them.

**2. Update Dependencies**

⭐ **Important:** After pulling new code, always update the dependencies to ensure you have the correct versions. Choose the command that matches your hardware:

*   **For CPU-Only Systems:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
*   **For NVIDIA GPU Systems (CUDA 12.1):**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements-nvidia.txt
    ```
*   **For NVIDIA GPU Systems (CUDA 12.8 / Blackwell):**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements-nvidia-cu128.txt
    pip install --no-deps git+https://github.com/devnen/chatterbox-v2.git@master
    ```
*   **For AMD GPU Systems:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements-rocm.txt
    ```

**3. Restart the Server**

If the server was running, stop it (`CTRL+C`) and restart it to apply all the updates.

```bash
python server.py
```

⭐ **Note:** Your custom settings in `config.yaml` are preserved with this method. The server will automatically add any new configuration options with default values if needed. You can safely delete `config.yaml.backup` once you've verified everything works correctly.

⭐ **Docker Users:** If using Docker and you have a local `config.yaml` mounted as a volume, the same backup/restore process applies before running:
```bash
docker compose down
docker compose pull  # if using pre-built images
docker compose up -d --build
```

**For RTX 5090 / Blackwell GPUs:** Use the CUDA 12.8 configuration:
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose-cu128.yml down
docker compose -f docker-compose-cu128.yml pull
docker compose -f docker-compose-cu128.yml up -d --build
```

## 💡 Usage

### Web UI (`http://localhost:PORT`)

The most intuitive way to use the server:

*   **Engine Selector:** Use the dropdown at the top to switch between **Original Chatterbox** and **Chatterbox‑Turbo**. The backend auto-loads the selected engine.
*   **Text Input:** Enter your plain text script. **For audiobooks:** Simply paste the entire book text - the chunking system will automatically handle long texts and create seamless audio output.   
*   **Voice Mode:** Choose:
    *   `Predefined Voices`: Select a curated voice from the `./voices` directory.
    *   `Voice Cloning`: Select an uploaded reference file from `./reference_audio`.
*   **Presets:** Load examples from `ui/presets.yaml`. New presets demonstrate Turbo's paralinguistic tags.
*   **Reference/Predefined Audio Management:** Import new files and refresh lists.
*   **Generation Parameters:** Adjust Temperature, Exaggeration, CFG Weight, Speed Factor, Seed. Save defaults to `config.yaml`.
*   **Chunking Controls:** Toggle "Split text into chunks" and adjust "Chunk Size" for long texts.
*   **Server Configuration:** View/edit parts of `config.yaml` (requires server restart for some changes).
*   **Audio Player:** Play generated audio with waveform visualization.

### Using Paralinguistic Tags (Turbo)

When the engine selector is set to **Chatterbox‑Turbo**, you can include paralinguistic tags inline:

```
Hi there [chuckle] — thanks for calling back.
One moment… [cough] sorry about that. Let's get this fixed.
```

Turbo supports native tags like `[laugh]`, `[cough]`, and `[chuckle]` for more realistic, expressive speech. These tags are ignored when using Original Chatterbox.

### API Endpoints (`/docs` for interactive details)

The primary endpoint for TTS generation is `/tts`, which offers detailed control over the synthesis process.

*   **`/tts` (POST):** Main endpoint for speech generation.
    *   **Request Body (`CustomTTSRequest`):**
        *   `text` (string, required): Plain text to synthesize.
        *   `voice_mode` (string, "predefined" or "clone", default "predefined"): Specifies voice source.
        *   `predefined_voice_id` (string, optional): Filename of predefined voice (if `voice_mode` is "predefined").
        *   `reference_audio_filename` (string, optional): Filename of reference audio (if `voice_mode` is "clone").
        *   `output_format` (string, "wav" or "opus", default "wav").
        *   `split_text` (boolean, default True): Whether to chunk long text.
        *   `chunk_size` (integer, default 120): Target characters per chunk.
        *   `temperature`, `exaggeration`, `cfg_weight`, `seed`, `speed_factor`, `language`: Generation parameters overriding defaults.
    *   **Response:** Streaming audio (`audio/wav` or `audio/opus`).
*   **`/v1/audio/speech` (POST):** OpenAI-compatible.
    *   `input`: Text.
    *   `voice`: 'S1', 'S2', 'dialogue', 'predefined_voice_filename.wav', or 'reference_filename.wav'.
    *   `response_format`: 'opus' or 'wav'.
    *   `speed`: Playback speed factor (0.5-2.0).
    *   `seed`: (Optional) Integer seed, -1 for random.    
*   **Helper Endpoints (mostly for UI):**
    *   `GET /api/ui/initial-data`: Fetches all initial configuration, file lists, and presets for the UI.
    *   `POST /save_settings`: Saves partial updates to `config.yaml`.
    *   `POST /reset_settings`: Resets `config.yaml` to defaults.
    *   `GET /get_reference_files`: Lists files in `reference_audio/`.
    *   `GET /get_predefined_voices`: Lists formatted voices from `voices/`.
    *   `POST /upload_reference`: Uploads reference audio files.
    *   `POST /upload_predefined_voice`: Uploads predefined voice files.
# 🐳 Docker Installation

Run Chatterbox TTS Server easily using Docker. The recommended method uses Docker Compose, which is pre-configured for different GPU types.

## Prerequisites

*   [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed.
*   [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed (usually included with Docker Desktop).
*   **(For GPU acceleration)**
    *   **NVIDIA:** Up-to-date drivers and the [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html) installed.
    *   **AMD:** Up-to-date [ROCm drivers](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/) installed on a Linux host. User must be in `video` and `render` groups.

## Using Docker Compose (Recommended)

This method uses the provided `docker-compose.yml` files to manage the container, volumes, and configuration easily.

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/devnen/Chatterbox-TTS-Server.git
cd Chatterbox-TTS-Server
```

### 2. Start the Container Based on Your Hardware

#### **For NVIDIA GPU:**
The default `docker-compose.yml` is configured for NVIDIA GPUs.
```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

#### **For AMD ROCm GPU (Linux only):**
**Prerequisites:** Ensure you have [ROCm drivers](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/) installed on your host system and your user is in the required groups:
```bash
# Add your user to required groups (one-time setup)
sudo usermod -a -G video,render $USER
# Log out and back in for changes to take effect
```

**Start the container:**
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose-rocm.yml up -d --build
```

#### **For CPU-only:**
A dedicated compose file is now provided for CPU-only users to avoid GPU driver errors.
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose-cpu.yml up -d --build
```

⭐ **Note:** The first time you run this, Docker will build the image and download model files, which can take some time. Subsequent starts will be much faster.

### 3. Access the Application
Open your web browser to `http://localhost:PORT` (e.g., `http://localhost:8004` or the host port you configured).

### 4. Verify GPU Access

#### **For NVIDIA GPU:**
```bash
# Check if container can see NVIDIA GPU
docker compose exec chatterbox-tts-server nvidia-smi

# Verify PyTorch can access the GPU
docker compose exec chatterbox-tts-server python3 -c "import torch; print(f'CUDA available: {torch.cuda.is_available()}'); print(f'GPU count: {torch.cuda.device_count()}')"
```

#### **For AMD ROCm GPU:**
```bash
# Check if container can see AMD GPU

## AMD ROCm Support Details

### **GPU Architecture Override (Advanced Users)**

If your AMD GPU is not officially supported by ROCm but is similar to a supported architecture, you can override the detected architecture:

```bash
# For RX 5000/6000 series (gfx10xx) - override to gfx1030
HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION=10.3.0 docker compose -f docker-compose-rocm.yml up -d

# For RX 7000 series (gfx11xx) - override to gfx1100  
HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION=11.0.0 docker compose -f docker-compose-rocm.yml up -d

# For Vega cards - override to gfx906
HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION=9.0.6 docker compose -f docker-compose-rocm.yml up -d
```

**Check your GPU architecture:**
```bash
# Method 1: Using rocminfo (if ROCm installed on host)
rocminfo | grep "Name:"

# Method 2: Using lspci
lspci | grep VGA
```

**Common GPU Architecture Mappings:**
- **RX 7900 XTX/XT, RX 7800 XT, RX 7700 XT:** gfx1100 → Use `HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION=11.0.0`
- **RX 6900 XT, RX 6800 XT, RX 6700 XT, RX 6600 XT:** gfx1030-1032 → Use `HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION=10.3.0`
- **RX 5700 XT, RX 5600 XT:** gfx1010 → Use `HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION=10.3.0`
- **Vega 64, Vega 56:** gfx900-906 → Use `HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION=9.0.6`

### **ROCm Compatibility Notes**

*   **Supported GPUs:** AMD Instinct data center GPUs and select Radeon GPUs. Check the [ROCm compatibility list](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/reference/system-requirements.html#supported-gpus).
*   **Operating System:** ROCm is currently supported only on Linux systems.
*   **Performance:** AMD GPUs with ROCm provide excellent performance for ML workloads, with support for mixed-precision training.
*   **PyTorch Version:** Uses PyTorch 2.6.0 with ROCm 6.4.1 for optimal compatibility and performance.

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Launcher Issues

*   **"Python not found" error:**
    - Ensure Python 3.10+ is installed and added to PATH
    - Windows: Reinstall Python and check "Add Python to PATH" during installation
    - Linux: Install with `sudo apt install python3 python3-venv python3-pip`

*   **"venv module not found" (Linux):**
    ```bash
    sudo apt install python3-venv
    ```

*   **Installation hangs or fails:**
    - Run with verbose mode for details: `python start.py --reinstall --verbose`
    - Check internet connection
    - Ensure sufficient disk space (10GB+ recommended)

*   **Permission errors removing venv (Windows):**
    - Close all terminals and editors that might have files open in the venv folder
    - Try running as Administrator
    - Manually delete the venv folder: `rmdir /s /q venv`

*   **How do I switch between portable and standard mode?**
    - Use `--reinstall` to remove the existing environment and choose again
    - Or specify directly: `python start.py --reinstall --portable` or `python start.py --reinstall --no-portable`

*   **I shared my portable folder but models are downloading again:**
    - TTS models are cached separately from the application folder (in the Hugging Face cache)
    - Each machine downloads models once on first run
    - To include models in the portable package, set `model_cache` in `config.yaml` to a path inside the project folder

*   **Portable mode isn't offered / I'm on Linux:**
    - Portable Mode is Windows-only. On Linux and macOS, the standard virtual environment is used, which works reliably on those platforms

*   **Wrong hardware detected:**
    - The launcher detects NVIDIA GPUs via `nvidia-smi` and AMD GPUs via `rocm-smi`
    - If detection fails, use direct installation flags: `--cpu`, `--nvidia`, `--nvidia-cu128`, `--rocm`

*   **Checking installation type:**
    ```bash
    # The installation type is stored in venv/.install_type
    cat venv/.install_type  # Linux/macOS
    type venv\.install_type  # Windows
    ```

### Apple Silicon (MPS) Issues

*   **MPS Not Available:** Ensure you have macOS 12.3+ and an Apple Silicon Mac. Verify with `python -c "import torch; print(torch.backends.mps.is_available())"`
*   **Installation Conflicts:** If you encounter version conflicts, follow the exact Apple Silicon installation sequence in Option 4, installing PyTorch first before other dependencies.
*   **ONNX Build Errors:** Use the specific ONNX version `pip install onnx==1.16.0` as shown in the installation steps.
*   **Model Loading Errors:** Ensure `config.yaml` has `device: mps` in the `tts_engine` section.

### NVIDIA GPU Issues

*   **CUDA Not Available / Slow:** Check NVIDIA drivers (`nvidia-smi`), ensure correct CUDA-enabled PyTorch is installed (see Installation options).
*   **"No kernel image available" error:**
    - For RTX 5090/Blackwell: Use `--nvidia-cu128` or `requirements-nvidia-cu128.txt` instead of standard NVIDIA installation
    - For older GPUs (RTX 20/30/40): Use `--nvidia` or `requirements-nvidia.txt`
*   **VRAM Out of Memory (OOM):**
    *   Ensure your GPU meets minimum requirements for Chatterbox.
    *   Close other GPU-intensive applications.
    *   If processing very long text even with chunking, try reducing `chunk_size` (e.g., 100-150).

### AMD GPU Issues

*   **ROCm not working on Windows:**
    - ROCm only supports Linux - use CPU mode on Windows with AMD GPUs
    - The launcher will warn you if you select ROCm on Windows

### General Issues

*   **Import Errors (e.g., `chatterbox-tts`, `librosa`):** Ensure virtual environment is active and dependencies installed successfully. Try reinstalling: `python start.py --reinstall`
*   **`libsndfile` Error (Linux):** Run `sudo apt install libsndfile1`.
*   **Model Download Fails:** Check internet connection. `ChatterboxTTS.from_pretrained()` will attempt to download from Hugging Face Hub. Ensure `model.repo_id` in `config.yaml` is correct.
*   **Voice Cloning/Predefined Voice Issues:**
    *   Ensure files exist in the correct directories (`./reference_audio`, `./voices`).
    *   Check server logs for errors related to file loading or processing.
*   **Permission Errors (Saving Files/Config):** Check write permissions for `./config.yaml`, `./logs`, `./outputs`, `./reference_audio`, `./voices`, and the Hugging Face cache directory if using Docker volumes.
*   **UI Issues / Settings Not Saving:** Clear browser cache/local storage. Check browser developer console (F12) for JavaScript errors. Ensure `config.yaml` is writable by the server process.
*   **Port Conflict (`Address already in use`):** Another process is using the port. Stop it or change `server.port` in `config.yaml` (requires server restart).
    - Find process using port: `netstat -ano | findstr :8004` (Windows) or `lsof -i :8004` (Linux)
*   **Generation Cancel Button:** This is a "UI Cancel" - it stops the *frontend* from waiting but doesn't instantly halt ongoing backend model inference. Clicking Generate again cancels the previous UI wait.

### Selecting GPUs on Multi-GPU Systems

Set the `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment variable **before** running `python server.py` (or before running the launcher) to specify which GPU(s) PyTorch should see. The server uses the first visible one (effectively `cuda:0` from PyTorch's perspective).

*   **Example (Use only physical GPU 1):**
    *   Linux/macOS: `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES="1" python server.py`
    *   Windows CMD: `set CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1 && python server.py`
    *   Windows PowerShell: `$env:CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES="1"; python server.py`

*   **Example (Use physical GPUs 6 and 7 - server uses GPU 6):**
    *   Linux/macOS: `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES="6,7" python server.py`
    *   Windows CMD: `set CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=6,7 && python server.py`
    *   Windows PowerShell: `$env:CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES="6,7"; python server.py`

**Note:** `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` selects GPUs; it does **not** fix OOM errors if the chosen GPU lacks sufficient memory.

### Verification Commands

**Check Python version:**
```bash
python --version
```

**Check PyTorch and CUDA:**
```bash
python -c "import torch; print(f'PyTorch: {torch.__version__}'); print(f'CUDA: {torch.cuda.is_available()}')"
```

**Check PyTorch architectures (for Blackwell support):**
```bash
python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.get_arch_list())"
```

**Test server manually:**
```bash
# Activate venv first, then:
python server.py
```

## Configuration in Docker

*   **Main config:** The server uses `config.yaml` for settings. The docker-compose files mount your local `config.yaml` to `/app/config.yaml` inside the container.
*   **First run:** If `config.yaml` doesn't exist locally, the application will create a default one with sensible defaults.
*   **Editing config:** You can edit the local `config.yaml` directly. Changes to server/model/path settings require a container restart:
    ```bash
    docker compose restart chatterbox-tts-server
    ```
*   **UI settings:** Changes to generation defaults and UI state are often saved automatically by the application.

## Docker Volumes

Persistent data is stored on your host machine via volume mounts:

*   `./config.yaml:/app/config.yaml` - Main application configuration
*   `./voices:/app/voices` - Predefined voice audio files  
*   `./reference_audio:/app/reference_audio` - Your uploaded reference audio files for cloning
*   `./outputs:/app/outputs` - Generated audio files saved from UI/API
*   `./logs:/app/logs` - Server log files
*   `hf_cache:/app/hf_cache` - Named volume for Hugging Face model cache (persists downloads)

**Managing volumes:**
```bash
# Remove all data (including downloaded models)
docker compose down -v

# Remove only application data (keep model cache)
docker compose down
sudo rm -rf voices/ reference_audio/ outputs/ logs/ config.yaml

# View volume usage
docker system df
```
